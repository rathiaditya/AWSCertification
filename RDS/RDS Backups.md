# ðŸ’¾ RDS and Aurora: Backup, Restore, & Cloning Guide

Understanding backup mechanisms is essential for data durability and cost management in AWS RDS and Aurora.

-----

## ðŸ”’ RDS Backup Options

AWS RDS provides two main backup methods: Automated Backups and Manual Snapshots.

### 1\. Automated Backups (Point-in-Time Recovery - PITR)

  * **Mechanism:** RDS performs a **daily full backup** during the defined backup window. Additionally, **transaction logs** are backed up every **five minutes**.
  * **Restore:** Allows restore to **any point in time** up until **five minutes ago**.
  * **Retention:** Configurable from **1 to 35 days**.
  * **Disabling:** Can be **disabled** by setting the retention period to **zero (0)**.

### 2\. Manual DB Snapshots

  * **Trigger:** Manually triggered by the user.
  * **Retention:** Can be retained for **as long as you want** (they **do not expire** like automated backups).

### ðŸ’¡ Cost-Saving Trick (Exam Tip\!)

To save costs on a database you use infrequently (e.g., 2 hours/month):

1.  Take a **Manual DB Snapshot**.
2.  **Delete** the original RDS instance.
3.  The snapshot storage is **significantly cheaper** than the running or stopped database instance storage.
4.  When needed, **restore** the snapshot to a new instance.

## ðŸŒŸ Aurora Backup Options

Aurora backups are similar to RDS but with a key difference regarding mandatory automation.

| Feature | RDS | Aurora |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Automated Backups** | 1 to 35 days. Can be **disabled** (set to 0). | 1 to 35 days. **Cannot be disabled**. |
| **PITR** | Restore up to 5 minutes ago. | Point-in-time recovery to any point in the retention window. |
| **Manual Snapshots** | Manually triggered. Retained indefinitely. | Manually triggered. Retained indefinitely. |

## ðŸ”„ Restore and Migration Options

Restoring a backup always creates a **new database instance** (or cluster).

### 1\. Standard Restore

  * Restoring an **Automated Backup** or a **Manual DB Snapshot** (RDS or Aurora) always results in a **new database instance/cluster**.

### 2\. Restoring from Amazon S3 (On-Premises Migration)

This facilitates migrating an external (e.g., on-premises) database into AWS RDS or Aurora. **Amazon S3** is used as the staging location for the backup file.

| Destination | Required Backup Format | Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RDS MySQL** | Standard MySQL backup dump. | On-Prem Backup $\rightarrow$ S3 $\rightarrow$ New RDS MySQL Instance. |
| **Aurora MySQL** | Backup must be created using the **Percona XtraBackup** software. | On-Prem Backup (Percona) $\rightarrow$ S3 $\rightarrow$ New Aurora MySQL Cluster. |

## ðŸš€ Aurora Database Cloning (Copy-on-Write)

Aurora Database Cloning is a fast and efficient way to create copies of an existing Aurora cluster, ideal for staging or testing environments.

  * **Goal:** Create a **new Aurora database cluster** from an existing one (e.g., Production to Staging).
  * **Speed:** Significantly **faster** than the standard snapshot-and-restore process.
  * **Protocol:** Uses the **Copy-on-Write (CoW)** protocol.
  * **Mechanism:**
    1.  When cloned, the new cluster initially uses the **same shared storage volume** as the source cluster (very fast, no data copying).
    2.  As data is **updated/modified** on *either* the source or the clone, new, separate storage blocks are allocated, and the data is copied only as needed.
  * **Benefit:** Fast creation and cost-effective, as duplicate storage is only consumed for *changed* data.

    style S fill:#ddf,stroke:#333
    style S_P fill:#ccf,stroke:#333
    style S_S fill:#fcc,stroke:#333

    note right of S: Initially, both point to the same data blocks.
    note right of S_P: Write on Prod causes new block to be allocated (Copy-on-Write).
    note right of S_S: Write on Staging causes new block to be allocated (Copy-on-Write).
