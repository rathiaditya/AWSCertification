# AWS EC2 Instance Types 🚀

## Summary
This session explored the different **EC2 instance types** in AWS, their naming conventions, and real-world use cases. Understanding instance families is key to selecting the right balance of **compute, memory, storage, and networking** for your workload.

---

## Key Learnings

### 🔑 Naming Convention
Example: `m5.2xlarge`
- **m** → Instance class (e.g., General Purpose)  
- **5** → Generation (hardware improvements over time)  
- **2xlarge** → Size (more CPU, RAM, storage as size increases)

---

### 🖥️ Instance Families

#### 1. General Purpose (`t`, `m` series)
- **Balanced**: compute, memory, networking  
- **Use cases**: web servers, code repositories, everyday workloads  
- **Example**: `t2.micro` (Free Tier)

#### 2. Compute Optimized (`c` series)
- **Focus**: high-performance CPU  
- **Use cases**: batch processing, media transcoding, HPC, machine learning, gaming servers  

#### 3. Memory Optimized (`r`, `x`, `z` series)
- **Focus**: large data sets in memory  
- **Use cases**:  
  - Relational / NoSQL databases  
  - In-memory caches (e.g., ElastiCache, Redis)  
  - BI applications  
  - Real-time big data analytics  

#### 4. Storage Optimized (`i`, `d`, `h` series)
- **Focus**: high-performance local storage  
- **Use cases**:  
  - OLTP systems  
  - NoSQL & relational databases  
  - Data warehousing  
  - Distributed file systems  

---

### 📊 Comparing Instance Sizes
- `t2.micro` → 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM (entry-level)  
- `r5.16xlarge` → 16 vCPU, 512 GB RAM (memory-heavy)  
- `c5d.4xlarge` → 16 vCPU, 32 GB RAM (compute-heavy)  

This highlights how **different families prioritize CPU vs. memory vs. storage**.

## Takeaway
Choosing the right **EC2 instance type** is about understanding workload needs:
- General workloads → **General Purpose**  
- CPU-heavy tasks → **Compute Optimized**  
- Data-in-memory workloads → **Memory Optimized**  
- Storage-intensive systems → **Storage Optimized**  

📌 This knowledge is fundamental for **cost optimization** and **application performance** in AWS.
