# âš¡ AWS Placement Groups â€“ Learning Notes

This note summarizes my learning on **AWS EC2 Placement Groups**, which control how EC2 instances are placed on AWS hardware for performance, availability, or partition tolerance.  

Placement Groups donâ€™t give direct hardware control but let AWS know how we want EC2s positioned relative to each other.

## ðŸ›  Types of Placement Groups

### 1. **Cluster Placement Group**
- **Setup**: Instances are grouped **within a single Availability Zone (AZ)**.  
- **Benefits**:  
  - High network performance (up to 10 Gbps with enhanced networking).  
  - Low latency, high throughput between instances.  
- **Risks**:  
  - All instances fail if the AZ fails (high risk).  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Big Data jobs requiring fast completion.  
  - High-performance computing workloads.  
  - Applications needing ultra-low latency networking.  

---

### 2. **Spread Placement Group**
- **Setup**: Instances are spread across **different hardware** within an AZ (and can span AZs).  
- **Limits**: Maximum **7 instances per AZ** per placement group.  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Reduced risk of simultaneous failure.  
  - High availability by isolating instances.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Critical applications.  
  - Workloads needing maximum failure isolation.

### 3. **Partition Placement Group**
- **Setup**: Instances are divided across **partitions**, each representing separate hardware racks.  
- **Scalability**: Up to **7 partitions per AZ**; supports **hundreds of instances**.  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Each partition is isolated from failures of other partitions.  
  - Can span multiple AZs within the same region.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Partition-aware distributed systems (HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Apache Kafka).  
  - Large-scale, fault-tolerant data applications.

## ðŸ“Š Comparison

| Type       | Max Instances | Scope            | Key Benefit              | Risk                           | Best For |
|------------|--------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|----------|
| Cluster    | No hard cap  | 1 AZ             | Low latency, high throughput | AZ failure affects all         | HPC, Big Data jobs |
| Spread     | 7 per AZ     | Across AZs       | High availability, isolation | Limited scalability            | Critical apps |
| Partition  | 100s         | Across partitions & AZs | Large-scale, partition isolation | Partition failure affects only one rack | Distributed systems |

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways
- **Cluster** = Performance focus (fast jobs, high risk).  
- **Spread** = Availability focus (critical apps, smaller scale).  
- **Partition** = Scalability focus (big data, partition-aware apps).  
- Placement Groups let AWS optimize hardware placement for **networking, fault tolerance, or partitioning**, depending on workload needs.
